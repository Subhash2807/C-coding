Basic Concepts of C++

In this section we will cover the basics of C++, it will include the syntax, variable, operators, loop types, pointers, references and information about other requirements of a C++ program. You will come across lot of terms that you have already studied in C language.
Syntax and Structure of C++ program

Here we will discuss one simple and basic C++ program to print "Hello this is C++" and its structure in parts with details and uses.

First C++ program
#include <iostream.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout << "Hello this is C++"; 
}
Header files are included at the beginning just like in C program. Here iostream is a header file which 
provides us with input & output streams.Header files contained predeclared function libraries, which can
be used by users for their ease. 
Using namespace std, tells the compiler to use standard namespace. Namespace collects identifiers used for class, object and variables.
NameSpace can be used by two ways in a program, either by the use of using statement at the beginning, like we did in above mentioned
program or by using name of namespace as prefix before the identifier with scope resolution (::) operator. 
Example: std::cout << "A";
 main(), is the function which holds the executing part of program its return type is int.

cout <<, is used to print anything on screen, same as printf in C language. cin and cout are same as scanf and printf, only difference 
is that you do not need to mention format specifiers like, %d for int etc, in cout & cin. 

Comments in C++ Program
For single line comments, use // before mentioning comment, like

cout<<"single line";   // This is single line comment

For multiple line comment, enclose the comment between /* and */

/*this is 
  a multiple line 
  comment */
  code:
  #inlcude<bits/stdc++.h>
  using namespace std;
  int main()
  {
  // write your code here.
}
